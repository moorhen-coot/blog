## Scope

[Moorhen](2023-04-16-moorhen.md) is built on React, and has been designed to be readily inserted
into React apps to provide Moorhen's capabilities for viewing and editing macromolecular structures.  This tutorial is part of a series that will show how to 

1. Build a simple Moorhen app, starting from `create-react-app` (this tutorial) 
2. Specialize that app to pull in structures and maps from an API [tutorial 2](), and
3. Provide dedicated UI elements to navigate around features of a structure within the Moorhen component [tutorial 3]()

## Background and requirements

To follow this tutorial, you will needs a computer with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) installed, and  access to a (code) editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).

## Getting started

To start with, we will use the `create-react-app` tool to generate a simple react application. 
`create-react-app` is a command line npx script provided by your NodeJS installation. To use it, you will first need to launch a terminal application on your computer, navigate to the place you'd like to initiate your app and invoke the create-react-app command:

    npx create-react-app my-moorhen-app

This will create a minimal create-react-app called `my-moorhen-app`, the composition of which  is described [elsewhere](https://create-react-app.dev). You are encouraged to work through the tutorial on the [`create react app`](https://create-react-app.dev) web site if this is your first experience using it. For the purpose of this tutorial, you can also simply preview the app that has been created:

    cd my-moorhen-app
    npm run start

You should see the default `create-react-app` webpage:

A few actions and edits are needed to make this a Moorhen application. The first is to use the Node Package Manager (npm) to install Moorhen and its dependencies.

We are exploring the licensing position of making moorhen available as an npm package.  For now, the package is available as a gzipped tar file from the principal curator of the package <filomeno.sanchezrodriguez@york.ac.uk>.  

After obtaining the moorhen package, copy it into the root directory of your `my-moorhen-app`

    cp path_to/moorhen-0.1.0.tgz .

(where path_to is used to specify the directory in which you ahve downloaded the gzipped tar file)

The next action is to use the node package manager to install it, and to retrieve its dependencies

    npm install ./moorhen-0.1.0.tgz

A Moorhen app requires certain static assets to be available from the app's HTTP server at a path beginning `/baby-gru`.  To place those files in the appropriate place for the create-react-app build system, a copy command is required:

    cp -r node_modules/moorhen/baby-gru ./public/

To protect javascript app users, browsers allow the enforcement of a `cross origin policy` that mitigates (for example) the execution of javascript code injected by a malicious player. This restriction means we have to configure the create-react-app development server to insert some headers:

    cat > src/setupProxy.js << EOF
    module.exports = function (app) {
        app.use(function (req, res, next) {
            res.setHeader("Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy", "same-origin");
            res.setHeader("Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy", "require-corp");
            next();
        });
    };   
    EOF 

The main Moorhen UI thread needs to be able to use certain web-assembled crystallography tools, and enabling this requires an edit to the file `public/index.html`

In `public/index.html`, after the comment stanza:

    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
    -->

Insert the following two blocks of code:

    <script>
      // See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20829#issuecomment-802088260
      if (!crossOriginIsolated) SharedArrayBuffer = ArrayBuffer;
    </script>

(Required to deal with a cross origin issue)
  
    <!--Here some imports and actions to make some crystallographic logic available to the main UI thread (as opposed to the CootWorker)-->
    <script>
      window.onload = () => {
        createCCP4Module({
          print(t) { console.log(["output", t]) },
          printErr(t) { console.log(["output", t]); }
        })
          .then(function (CCP4Mod) {
            window.CCP4Module = CCP4Mod;
          })
          .catch((e) => {
            console.log("CCP4 problem :(");
            console.log(e);
          });
      }
    </script>

    <script src="%PUBLIC_URL%/baby-gru/wasm/web_example.js"></script>

(Required to load crystallographic tools for the main GUI thread)

Finally, we need to replace the default create-react-app content with a Moorhen view in file `src/App.js`.  To achieve this, we have to add imports into the top of `src/App.js`:

    import {MoorhenContext, MoorhenContainer} from 'moorhen'

And then replace the default create-react-app content:

    <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a
          className="App-link"
          href="https://reactjs.org"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >
          Learn React
        </a>
    </header>

with the following content

    <MoorhenContextProvider>
        <MoorhenContainer urlPrefix="."/>
    </MoorhenContextProvider>

Now if you reload the page in your  web browser, you should be seeing the base moorhen app:
